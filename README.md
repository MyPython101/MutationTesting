# Mutation Testing using Python

## Introduction
- Python packages that support mutation testing:  mutpy, 
  - mutation-waterfall 0.1.1: Python library for visualizing mutation landscape as waterfall diagram.
  - mutmut 2.4.0:
  - mutpy 0.6.1:
  - mutation 0.4.7: test mutations for pytest. The goal of mutation is to give an idea on how robust, and help improve test suites.

## Mutation Testing Overview
- Mutation testing (or Mutation analysis or Program mutation) evaluates the quality of software tests. 
- Mutation testing involves modifying a program's source code or byte code in small ways. 
- A test suite that does not detect and reject the mutated code is considered defective. 
- These so-called mutations, are based on well-defined mutation operators that either mimic typical programming errors 
(such as using the wrong operator or variable name) or force the creation of valuable tests (such as driving each expression to zero). 
- The purpose is to help the tester develop effective tests or locate weaknesses in the test data used for the program or in sections of the code that are seldom or never accessed during execution.

## Requirement:
- Knowledge of Python Programming
- Basic Command Line to develop automation test (optional)
- 

## Advantage of mutpy:
- Code base, easy to implement automation

## Installation: 
-

## Technology
List of technology
- Python 
- Object Oriented Design
- PyCharm IDE

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- PyCharm Community IDE: Be More Productive: Save time while PyCharm takes care of the routine. Focus on the bigger things and embrace the keyboard-centric approach to get the most of PyCharm's many productivity features. Get Smart Assistance: PyCharm knows everything about your code. Rely on it for intelligent code completion, on-the-fly error checking and quick-fixes, easy project navigation, and much more.
- Please download open the source folder as a project (right click on the folder that contain main, templates, static, and venv and run as open Python Project using PyCharm).
- PLease download all the necessary packages before run the application. If you use PyCharm, it will take care of your missing package or
```
# or u can use
pip install all-missing-package(replace all-missing-package with the package(packages) that you intend to install)
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:
* Install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) Community Edition.
